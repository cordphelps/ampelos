Full Title Does Semi-Natural Habitat Amplify Beneficial Spider Populations in a California Organic Vineyard?Author(s) R. Cord Phelps 1, *Lindsey Norgrove 2Author affiliation(s)  :  Bern University of Applied SciencesConclusion We conclude that, for a California Central Coast organic vineyard, SNH dominated by mature oak trees promotes populations of the generalist spiders Thomisidae beyond the first 15 meters of the transect. This result suggests that producers could consider reinforcing SNH effects by emphasizing under-trellis cover crop strategies for the initial 15 meters of the rows. Introduction- Researchers have examined the role of the “field margin” as a source of insects that could control vineyard pests (Altieri 2005, Hogg 2010, Hogg 2018, Nichols 2001, Ponti 2005, Thomson 2009, Wilson 2015). - However, the general response of agricultural systems to the composition of surrounding landscape is inconsistent (Karp 2018). - Purpose: to develop some insight into spatial and temporal patterns of beneficial insect penetration of organic vineyard rows supported by semi-natural habitat typical of the California Central Coast.- Assume the effect is strongest at the SNH vineyard edge- Assume the effect persists throughout the growing seasonMethods- Ampelos Vineyards : central coast oak savanna,  biodynamic / organic operations- Vane traps suspended in the fruit zone- 2 transects with 30 traps each extending 100 m into the vineyard center- Morning and evening sampling, 3X per weekDiscussion- Insect Diversity and Abundance in the Canopy- Crab Spider Abundance and Composition - Crab Spider Spatial Distribution- Crab Spider Population Clusters and Seasonal Presence- The Plausibility of SNH Influencing Crab Spider Populations-
